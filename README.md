## App Description:

- The purpose of this app is to keep track of the points for the user and their friends.

- On the home screen, the user is given the option to "Start New Game" and will then be able to select all the users they want, as well as create new ones. This includes a custom name for the user, as well as a custom desciption/ notes section. This could be useful for many things. For example, they create two users, "Team 1", and "Team 2", and they use the description to list out the names of everyone on that specific team.

- Created users need to be saved to the local storage, so that they do not need to re create them every time they start a new game or open the app.

- After they have started the game, and created their users, they will be able to score points within a round. There will be a button to "Add next Round", which will tally up the total points in that round for each user, as well as adding up all the total rounds so far.

- There will be a button that says "End game", which will render a popup of all the total points earned for each user, and two options, "View Details" and "New Game".

- If they tap "New Game", they will be asked if they want to edit users or not.

- There will be 2 ways a user can add ponts. 1) The user can tap a button which will quickly add points to that user (will be +1 as default but will have an option to change the increment amount) 2) The user will be able to manuall enter the ponts for the user (click the button, enter the number of points, hit okay).

- The user will also be able to choose a color for each coresponding user.
